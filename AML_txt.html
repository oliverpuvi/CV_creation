                As part of the compliance team the job of AML agents look into suspicious cases so as to determine whether there is a risk of money-laundering.
                That entails looking into the online presence of customers, if there is any, the logic of their transactions and other factors that contribute to the transactions being risky.
                The intern, in addition to getting acquainted and doing the regular work of agents, had to also carry out a research of their own choosing.
                The research I carried out was regarding a specific type of cases which seemed to be considered suspicious, but often it seemed like the reasoning behind why was lacking.
                I do appologize as I believe that I cannot go into any more specifics regarding the work or the project itself.
