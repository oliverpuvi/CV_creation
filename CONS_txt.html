            <p>
                I started off in the consulting wing of PwC Estonia as an intern in October 2021.
                For the first three months I then worked part-time on different projects, mainly having a smaller role and technical tasks. 
                After that I was offered a permanent contract and an opportunity to work with different teams in Consulting, which I decided to agree to.
                Having obtained the permanent contract I continued my work with the projects that I had been a part of during my internship as well as started to learn Alteryx and PowerBi to be integrated to the data team in PwC.
                I was able to do different projects ranging from internal audits and market research to more data driven projects that focused on optimizing PwC's internal resources.
                This opportunity helped me to understand the way businesses work and gave me a better understanding of the issues that large companies can have as well as what their expectations are.
                However, I felt that I wanted to get more into technical side and thus decided to pursue a degree in data science as opposed to economics.
